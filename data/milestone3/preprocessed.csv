PAIN AND NEUROGENIC INFLAMMATION;INTRADERMAL INJECTION OF CAPSAICIN INTO;Screening of a library of trimers of N alkylglycines resulted in the identification of two molecules referred to as DD161515 N 2 (2 (N methylpyrrolidinyl)ethylglycyl N 2,4 dichlorophenethylglycyl N (2,4 dichlorophenethyl)glycimide and DD191515 N 3 (N,N diethylamino)propylglycyl N 2,4 dichlorophenethylglycyl N (2,4 dichlorophenethyl)glycimide that selectively block VR1 channel activity with micromolar efficacy, rivaling that characteristic of vanilloid related inhibitors. These compounds appear to be noncompetitive VR1 antagonists that recognize a receptor site distinct from that of capsaicin.
